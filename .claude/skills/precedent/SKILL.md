# Precedent

*The automation's own skill, adapted to this repo; sync it when the automation releases.*

Every rule we automate is mostly moves we have made before. A **precedent** is an implemented clause that
shares **patterns** with the one in front of you; its entry and modules are where the new code starts. The
vocabulary is the automation's — `../isaacs-pf2e-automation/Docs/patterns.md` — and the lookup searches its
trackers and this repo's `Docs/clauses/` together.

Run this before reading any code. The lookup tells you which code to read.

## Steps

1. **Clausify.** Split the rule text into clauses: verbatim fragments of the guide, each one able to fail
   on its own, as the trackers in `Docs/clauses/` do. Done when every sentence that does something sits in
   exactly one clause, and pure GM rulings are set aside as `—`.

2. **Tag.** For each clause run

   ```sh
   npm run precedent -- --text "<the clause>"
   ```

   The suggested patterns come from key phrases, so treat them as a draft. Walk all eight facets —
   `when`, `reach`, `area`, `check`, `effect`, `ending`, `scaling`, `economy` — against the vocabulary:
   keep what the clause does, drop what it only mentions, add what the phrases missed. A value with variants
   takes one (`reach:area/cone`, `effect:forced-move/pull`). Done when every clause has its tag set and
   every facet has been asked.

3. **Read the precedents.** Run the confirmed set:

   ```sh
   npm run precedent -- --tags "when:cast reach:area/line check:basic-save effect:damage"
   ```

   Read the top hits' entries and modules in score order — they may be in either repo (`in:` says which).
   A ⚠️ or ❌ hit prints its gap: copy its approach, not its bug. Done when, for each clause, you can name
   the authored key or apply type that already expresses it — or say that none does.

4. **Write the row first.** Add the clause rows to the tracker with their **Patterns** cell filled, before
   the code exists. `npm run check:clauses` checks every tag against the vocabulary.

5. **Name new ground.** A pattern on the **No precedent** line, or a clause no value fits, is new ground.
   Tell the user before writing it. A new mechanism belongs in the automation, generic, reached through a
   registry — never a `wrap()` or a pattern of this repo's own. A missing value is an issue against the
   automation; tag what fits until it lands.

## Report

Per clause: its tags, its best precedent (ID, entry, module), and whether it is new ground.
