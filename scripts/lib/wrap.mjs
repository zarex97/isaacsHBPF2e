/**
 * One place in the module that knows how to wrap a system method.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that reached a release: two features registered a libWrapper wrapper for
 * `SpellcastingEntryPF2e#cast` under the same package id, libWrapper refused the second one by design, and
 * the throw took out the rest of the `setup` hook with it. The registry below turns that class of mistake
 * into an error naming *both* features at the moment it happens, and `build/test-riders.mjs` scans for it
 * statically so it never reaches a world at all.
 *
 * Two strategies, because the module genuinely needs both:
 *
 *  - `"auto"` (the default) uses libWrapper when it is installed and a plain prototype patch otherwise.
 *    libWrapper is the better neighbour — it chains with other modules wrapping the same method and reports
 *    conflicts — so it is used wherever it can be.
 *  - `"prototype"` always patches by hand, walking up to the prototype that actually declares the method.
 *    `ActorPF2e#applyDamage` needs this: it is declared once on the shared base and inherited by every
 *    actor type, and libWrapper would define the override on the one subclass it was given a path to,
 *    leaving NPCs — most of the things a Technique is aimed at — unwrapped.

 * Wrap a method. Returns true when the wrap took.

 *
 * @param {string} path       Dotted path to the method, e.g. `"CONFIG.PF2E.Item.documentClasses.x.prototype.y"`.
 *                            Must be a literal at the call site: the build scans for these.
 * @param {Function} wrapper  `function (wrapped, ...args)`.
 * @param {object} [options]
 * @param {string} options.feature    What breaks if this fails, for the log line and the conflict error.
 * @param {"MIXED"|"WRAPPER"|"OVERRIDE"} [options.type]  libWrapper type. Ignored by the plain patch.
