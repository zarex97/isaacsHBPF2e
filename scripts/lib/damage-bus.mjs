/**
 * The one wrap on `applyDamage`, and the stages that hang off it.
 *
 * pf2e emits nothing when damage lands, so anything that must see it — the IWR bypass, the rider engine,
 * Libra's halved healing, the Soulbound's refused wound and suppressed Regeneración — has to sit inside a
 * wrap of `ActorPF2e#applyDamage`. `wrap.mjs` refuses a second claim on the same method by design (that
 * refusal is the fix for the one crash that reached a release), so there can only ever be one wrapper,
 * and for a while every new consumer was pasted into it as another `try` block. By the fifth, the rider
 * engine was importing Soulbound code to call it, and the Assimilator brings at least four more.
 *
 * So the wrapper owns nothing but the order, and each consumer registers a **stage**:
 *
 *  - `before(actor, params)` runs before the damage is applied and may return an **undo**, which is
 *    called in a `finally` whatever happens — the IWR bypass shadows a target's Hardness and resistances
 *    for exactly one application, and a throw must never leave them lowered.
 *  - `after(actor, params, before)` runs after it, with the target's hit points from before the call, so
 *    "reduced to 0" and "regained N" are readings rather than inferences.
 *
 * Stages run in ascending `priority`. Each one is isolated: a stage that throws is logged by name and the
 * others still run, so one broken feature costs that feature and not the damage. The priorities in use
 * are listed on `PRIORITY` so a new stage can see where it falls without reading every caller.
