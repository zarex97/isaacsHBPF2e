/**
 * The one wrap on `game.pf2e.Check.roll`, and the stages that hang off it.
 *
 * `Check.roll` is the last place a check can be changed before the die falls: the modifiers are collected,
 * `context.substitutions` and `context.rollTwice` are filled in, and nothing has been rolled. pf2e fires
 * no hook there, so anything that must act on a check before it resolves has to sit inside a wrap of it —
 * and `wrap.mjs` refuses a second claim on the same method, which is the fix for the one crash that reached
 * a release. The Soulbound's Strikes that ignore cover were its only consumer; the Stargazer's armed
 * Portent is the second. This is `damage-bus.mjs`'s shape, for checks.
 *
 * A stage is `(check, context) => context | void`. It may return a **new** context — the cover stage swaps
 * in a copy with a corrected DC — or mutate the one it was given, which matters for the arrays pf2e reads
 * back after the roll: a rule element's `removeAfterRoll: "if-enabled"` consults `context.substitutions` on
 * the caller's own context object, so a stage that means pf2e to see a change there edits that array in
 * place rather than replacing it.
 *
 * Stages run in ascending `priority` and are isolated: a stage that throws is logged by name and the check
 * is still rolled. Whatever a feature wanted from a check, the roll matters more.
