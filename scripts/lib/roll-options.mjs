/**
 * The option set a targeting or rider predicate is tested against.
 *
 * Two families are in here. The first is the system's own: `Actor#getSelfRollOptions("target")` produces
 * `target:trait:undead`, `target:creature`, `target:size:large`, and those mean the same thing here that
 * they mean anywhere else in pf2e — a GM who knows the system's predicates already knows these.
 *
 * The second is ours, prefixed `rider:`. It exists because an escalating rider has to ask questions about
 * the target's *current* state — is it blinded yet, how many needles does it have, did that damage take it
 * to zero — and the answers have to be exact and stable. Reverse-engineering which of pf2e's internal
 * option strings happen to encode those, and depending on them not changing, is the fragile way to do it.
 * These are generated here, documented, and testable without Foundry.
