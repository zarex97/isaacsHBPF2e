/**
 * Taking a creature off the board, and putting it back.
 *
 * Three Techniques banish: *Another Dimension* folds space around someone for a minute (ten on a critical
 * failure), *Rikudō Rinne* sends a soul to one of the six realms, and *Freezing Coffin* seals a creature in
 * ice. All three were whispers — "banished into folded space for 1 minute, then returns to the square it
 * left" — and a whisper is exactly the thing that did not happen at the table.
 *
 * There is no Foundry state for "out of play". A hidden token is still targetable and still takes area
 * damage; an unconscious one is still standing there. The only honest answer is to remove the token and put
 * an identical one back, which is what this does — so the register below is not an implementation detail,
 * it *is* the feature: the token's whole source, its place in the initiative order, and the moment it comes
 * back, held somewhere that survives a reload.
 *
 * Two details matter more than they look:
 *
 *  - **The full source, not a reference.** An unlinked NPC token carries its own actor data — its damage,
 *    its conditions, the effects the party spent three rounds landing on it. Deleting the token deletes
 *    that actor. `toObject()` keeps the delta, and `keepId` brings the same token id back, so a macro or a
 *    module holding a uuid finds what it was holding.
 *  - **The clock, not a timer.** `setTimeout` dies with the page. Every record carries the world time it
 *    expires at, and the sweep runs on anything that moves the clock — which in combat is every turn.
