/**
 * Getting past a target's immunities, resistances and Hardness.
 *
 * The backlog said this needed "a damage-application hook that recomputes IWR with our overrides, since
 * `DamageAlteration` has no property for ignore-the-target's-resistance". The rule element indeed has no
 * such property — but the damage *roll* does. `roll.options.bypass` is a `DamageIRBypassData`
 * (`system/damage/types.ts`) that `applyIWR` reads on every application, and property runes are the only
 * thing populating it today. Merging into it rather than recomputing IWR ourselves means weaknesses,
 * immunity redirects, critical-hit immunity and the breakdown printed in chat all keep working.
 *
 * Two things it cannot do, and which are handled by shadowing the target instead:
 *
 *  - **Partial resistance reduction.** `IgnoredResistance` has a `max`, and its doc comment promises
 *    "ignore up to a maximum" — but `applyIWR` only ever reads it as a display value: an ignored
 *    resistance is dropped whole (`iwr.ts:210` filters on the boolean). *Atomic Dissolution*'s "treat
 *    resistance as 5 lower" therefore cannot go through `bypass` at all.
 *  - **Hardness**, which `applyDamage` reads straight off `actor.hardness` and which `bypass` says
 *    nothing about.

/**
 * Every bypass the origin is carrying, plus the one the damage came from.
 *
 * `dealtBy` is not a convenience. A Severing Art **ends Severance**, and Severance is what granted it, so
 * by the time the damage is applied the Art has been taken back off the sheet — and a scan of the
 * origin's live items finds nothing. Mugetsu says it "ignores all resistances and immunities to spirit
 * damage" and was being stopped dead by a target immune to spirit: 70 damage, 0 taken. Every one of the
 * fifteen Arts had the same hole, because ending Severance is the one thing they all do.
 *
 * The item that dealt the damage is the authority on what that damage gets past, whether or not the
 * sheet still lists it. Deduplicated by id so an item that *is* still equipped is not counted twice.
