 * Saint holding two Zenith activities fires both from one — two Fortitude saves and 16d6 twice for a single
 * use — because neither rider has a predicate to tell them apart, and neither should need one.
 *
 * `save-rolled` is the same argument, and it was left out of this set for one release. A save rider says
 * "a creature that fails *this* Technique's save is drained 1"; it names one Technique the way `action-used`
 * names one ability. With the wide search, every Technique on the sheet answered every save: *Scarlet
 * Needle* handed out *Crimson Mirage*'s dazzled and *Antares*' "it dies", *Sekishiki Konsō Ha* handed out
 * *Meikai Ha*'s drained, and *Another Dimension* handed out *Mavros Eruption Clast*'s blinded. Predicates
 * could not save it: 56 of the 57 save riders in the content carry none, and none of them should have to.
 *
 * The other events genuinely do need the wider search, which is why this is a list rather than a rule: a
 * Strike's `message.item` is the fist or the weapon, while "each time you hit with an unarmed Strike…" is
 * written on a Cloth's Ascendant effect, and only the predicate can narrow that back down.
 *
 * `aura-tick` joins them for the same reason `action-used` does: the item named is not a guess, it is
 * `Sources.onAuraTick` reading `flags.pf2e.aura.origin` straight off the marker pf2e's own Aura rule element
 * granted, and resolving one specific effect on that actor by hand — see `sources.mjs`. Searching the whole
 * actor would let a Saint who somehow carries two auras answer each other's ticks.
