     * A creature standing in an aura the caster is carrying.
     *
     * pf2e's own `Aura` rule element does the geometry, and only the geometry. The schema offers
     * `events: ["enter", "turn-start", "turn-end"]` and it reads that list **once**, to pick a default for
     * `removeOnExit`:
     *
     * ```ts
     * effect.removeOnExit ??= Array.isArray(effect.events) ? effect.events.includes("enter") : false;
     * ```
     *
     * That is the whole of it. `applyAreaEffects` never looks at `events` again — an aura effect is granted
     * the moment a token is inside, whenever `checkAuras` next runs, which is on token movement, a
     * disposition change or a scene preparation. So "enemies that end **their** turn in it" was paid out
     * whenever somebody walked past, and never at the end of anybody's turn.
     *
     * The marker is `Effect: Aura Tick` — content-free by design, so any Technique with a persistent aura
     * can reuse it. `flags.pf2e.aura` is stamped onto it natively by `applyAreaEffects`, and that is how
     * this is told which aura it belongs to and whose.
     *
     * The marker is deleted the moment it is read, win or lose: pf2e's re-grant check skips an effect the
     * target already carries (`itemTypes.effect.some(e => e.sourceId === uuid)`), so a marker left standing
     * would mean the aura fires exactly once, ever.
     *
     * **This path is the `enter` half only.** `turn-start` and `turn-end` are driven from the encounter
     * instead — see `onAuraTurn` — because pf2e will not time them, and the marker's arrival says nothing
     * about whose turn it is.
