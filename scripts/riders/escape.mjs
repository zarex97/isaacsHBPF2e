/**
 * The Escape a condition rider promises, made into something the captive can actually click.
 *
 * Thirteen condition riders across nine Soulbound abilities — Sai, Gritz, Rikujōkōrō, Kurohitsugi,
 * Hyōten Hyakkasō, Ryūsenka, Sennen Hyōrō, Sprenger and Minami's ash — carry `escapeDc: "reiatsu"`, and
 * every one of their descriptions says "(Escape against your Reiatsu DC)". Only `encasement.mjs` ever
 * read that key. On a condition rider it was inert: the condition landed with its timer and the Escape
 * did not exist anywhere, so the only way out was to wait the duration out.
 *
 * pf2e cannot supply it either. `immobilized` and `restrained` carry no native Escape action, `grabbed`
 * carries one with no DC attached, and nothing in the system knows that this particular grip is answered
 * by a Soulbound's Reiatsu DC. So the Escape is granted to the captive as a real action on their own
 * sheet, naming the DC and what it releases — the same shape `encasement.mjs` already grants against a
 * shell, and for the same reason.
 *
 * **Which skill.** pf2e's own Escape offers Acrobatics, Athletics or an unarmed attack roll, the
 * captive's choice. The first two are statistics this can roll; the unarmed modifier is assembled inside
 * the system's own action and is not a rollable statistic, so it is not offered here. The captive's
 * better of Acrobatics and Athletics is rolled, and the card says out loud that a table preferring the
 * unarmed roll can make it against the same DC. Content may name one skill with `escapeStatistic`.
