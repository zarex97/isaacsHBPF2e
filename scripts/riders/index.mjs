/**
 * Riders: what happens to a target *besides* damage.
 *
 * This is backlog §1. A rule element lives on the Saint's sheet and cannot write a condition onto a
 * target's sheet, so "a creature that fails is slowed 1 for 1 round" was always a line of text someone had
 * to notice and act on. Nothing about that is fixable from the item; it needs code that sees an outcome
 * and reaches the other actor.
 *
 * The shape is one pipeline, not one listener per feature. A handful of sources normalise what happened
 * into an event; the riders on the origin's items say what that event earns; a GM applies it. Adding
 * Virgo's sense loss or Pisces' garden is then a content change and a line in a table, rather than another
 * bespoke hook.
