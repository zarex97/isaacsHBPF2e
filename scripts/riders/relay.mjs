/**
 * Getting a rider onto a target's sheet.
 *
 * A player owns their Saint and nothing else, so they cannot write a condition onto the monster that just
 * failed its save — the request has to be carried out by a GM. Exactly one GM: `game.users.activeGM` is
 * Foundry's designated primary, so two GMs at the table do not both apply the same condition.
 *
 * The payload deliberately carries no rider data. It names an event, an item or a message, a target and an
 * outcome, and the GM reads the riders off the item themselves. A player therefore cannot ask for an
 * effect the Technique does not have, and a stale client cannot apply a rider that has since been edited
 * out of the compendium. That property is why every new event source added here is cheap: the trust
 * boundary does not move.
