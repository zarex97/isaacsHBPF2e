 * Riders that may fire once a round, and no more.

 * > as a free action.
 *
 * The rider machinery has `outcomes` and `predicate` and nothing that counts. So this one shipped as a
 * prompt with a note in its own JSON admitting the gap — *"Once per round; pf2e has no per-round gate on
 * a rider, so the card says once"* — and it then said so on the second hit, and the third, which is the
 * one thing the clause forbids.
 *
 * pf2e's `frequency` is the wrong tool: it belongs to an item the player *uses*, and it is spent by the
 * use rather than by the outcome. This fires off somebody else's Strike landing.
 *
 * So the count is kept where the allowance belongs — on the creature the rider is for — as one stamp per
 * rider naming the round it last fired in. `combat.id` is part of the stamp so a stale one from the last
 * encounter cannot suppress the first hit of the next, and the stamp is left behind rather than cleaned
 * up: it is two short strings, and a sweep would need a hook on every way a combat can end.
 *
 * **Out of combat there is no round**, so nothing is gated. A per-round allowance outside an encounter is
 * a sentence with no referent, and refusing the prompt there would be enforcing a rule the table cannot
 * see the boundaries of.
