/**
 * Put the Technique's area on the board and let the caster aim it.
 *
 * Foundry v14 already does the hard part: `canvas.regions.placeRegion` shows a preview that follows the
 * cursor, confirms on left-click, cancels on Esc, and turns on **Shift+wheel** (Ctrl for finer steps — a
 * plain wheel zooms the canvas, which is why the rotation is easy to miss and why the notification names
 * the keys). pf2e already overrides its snapping per area shape (`RegionLayerPF2e#placeRegion` keys off
 * `displayMeasurements` + coverage highlighting, both of which the data below sets).
 *
 * It is placed with `create: false`, which returns the preview document instead of saving it. That is not
 * an optimisation — the area is discarded a moment later either way, so nothing is lost, and it buys three
 * things: creating a Region needs the `REGION_CREATE` permission that an ordinary player may not have,
 * a non-GM cannot create one at all while the game is paused, and an unsaved document cannot be left
 * behind by an error. A document that was never written also never fires `createRegion`, so the toolbelt's
 * template popup stays out of the way without depending on it honouring a flag.
 *
 * Returns the aimed Region, or null if the caster backed out.
