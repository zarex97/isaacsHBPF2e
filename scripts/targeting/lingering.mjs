 * "the area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute" — and *Mavros Eruption Clast* leaves the ground
 * burning: "entering or ending a turn there deals 4d6 persistent fire". Both were prose. Neither could be
 * a rule element, because a rule element lives on an actor and this belongs to a patch of ground.
 *
 * The board already has the right object for it. Area targeting places the Technique's area as a Scene
 * Region and then throws it away; a lingering area is the same Region kept, with behaviors attached and an
 * expiry written onto it. Difficult terrain then costs no code at all — `modifyMovementCost` is a Foundry
 * behavior, so pathfinding, the ruler and the movement history all understand it without being told.
 *
 * The burning half does need code, and takes the supported route: a module may declare its own
 * RegionBehavior subtype in `module.json` and register the data model here. That gets the real region
 * events — `tokenMoveIn`, `tokenTurnEnd` — rather than a hook on token updates that would have to
 * re-derive containment Foundry has already worked out.
