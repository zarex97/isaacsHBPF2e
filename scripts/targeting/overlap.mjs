/**
 * What being caught by two areas at once is worth.
 *
 * *Lightning Crown* puts three pillars on the board and says: *"a creature caught by two or more rolls once
 * and takes damage once, but suffers a −2 circumstance penalty to that save."* The first half was already
 * true — `collect` in `index.mjs` merges the placements so a creature standing in two of them is one target
 * — and the second half was the part nobody could act on, because by the time the save is rolled the areas
 * have been discarded and nothing remembers how many caught it.
 *
 * So it is counted here, while the placements still exist, and written onto the creature as an effect that
 * lasts a round. The penalty is predicated on the Technique that caused it, so a creature standing in three
 * pillars is not also worse at dodging everything else that happens this round.
 *
 * The counting runs on the caster's client, because that is where the placements are; the writing runs on
 * the GM's, because a player cannot put an effect on a monster. That is the same split every rider uses,
 * so it goes through the same relay.
