 * Difficult terrain that only slows the people it was meant for.
 *
 * > **Senbonzakura** — The area is **difficult terrain for enemies** until the start of your next turn.
 *
 * Foundry's own `modifyMovementCost` behavior has exactly one field, `difficulties`, and no notion of who
 * is walking: a petal storm laid over a corridor slowed the caster's own party as readily as the enemy.
 * That is the whole of the gap — the terrain was real, it was simply indiscriminate.
 *
 * The seam Foundry does provide is `_getTerrainEffects(token, segment, options)`, which is handed the
 * token doing the moving. Subclassing the behavior and returning no effects for anyone on the caster's
 * side is all the filter needs to be, and it leaves every other part of Foundry's own implementation —
 * the schema, the twelve movement actions, the recalculation hooks — exactly where it was.
 *
 * Registered under the module's own type id, so a world that loses the module gets a behavior Foundry
 * does not recognise on an expired Region rather than a behavior that silently reverts to slowing allies.
